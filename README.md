# Java-FizzBuzz-Game
Implement a Java program that plays the ﬁzz buzz game for any possible number or series of numbers.

“Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".” – Wikipedia

Take into account the following expectations:

- The class FizzBuzz must have two characteristics: a starting and finishing number.
- The game is played in the method called fizzBuzz(). This class will output the results of the FizzBuzz game between the starting and the finishing number.
- If the game is played with a single number, the method is called fizzBuzzOne()
- Avoid code duplication!
- There is no need to implement a main() method.
